# ðŸŽµ Loci Social Features Implementation - Phase 2 Continuation

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Loci** is a social music discovery app that tracks Spotify listening sessions tied to physical locations. The core functionality (Phase 1) is complete, and we've successfully implemented the foundation for **Phase 2: Social Features** using Firebase. 

**Core Concept**: Users can discover what music is playing in nearby buildings in real-time, creating a location-based social music discovery experience.

## âœ… Current Implementation Status

### Firebase Infrastructure (COMPLETE)
- **Firebase Project**: `locijex` - fully configured with Firestore, Auth, Functions
- **iOS App Integration**: Bundle ID `com.jexpearce.Loci`, GoogleService-Info.plist ready
- **Authentication System**: Complete email/password auth with beautiful UI
- **Real-time Discovery**: Location-based music activity detection working
- **Data Architecture**: User profiles, sessions, building activity, privacy controls

### Key Files Implemented
1. **`FirebaseManager.swift`** (358 lines) - Complete Firebase service layer
2. **`AuthenticationView.swift`** (395 lines) - Beautiful auth UI with sign in/up
3. **`LocationDiscoveryView.swift`** (529 lines) - Core social discovery feature
4. **`LociApp.swift`** (247 lines) - Updated main app with Firebase integration

### Features Working
- âœ… User authentication with Firebase
- âœ… Real-time location-based discovery
- âœ… Building activity aggregation
- âœ… Session privacy controls (private/friends/public)
- âœ… Beautiful UI matching existing design system
- âœ… Tab-based navigation with Discovery tab

## ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority 1)

### 1. Complete Xcode Integration
The Firebase integration files are created but need to be properly integrated into the Xcode project:

**Required Actions:**
```bash
# Add Firebase SDK dependencies to Xcode:
# File â†’ Add Package Dependencies â†’ https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
# Select: FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore, FirebaseFunctions, FirebaseCore

# Add GoogleService-Info.plist to Xcode target
# Drag Loci/GoogleService-Info.plist into Xcode project
```

### 2. Update Existing Models
The Session model needs privacy level support. Add this to your existing `Models.swift`:

```swift
extension Session {
    enum PrivacyLevel: String, Codable, CaseIterable {
        case `private` = "private"
        case friends = "friends" 
        case `public` = "public"
        
        var displayName: String {
            switch self {
            case .private: return "Private"
            case .friends: return "Friends Only"
            case .public: return "Public"
            }
        }
    }
    
    var privacyLevel: PrivacyLevel {
        get {
            return PrivacyLevel(rawValue: self.metadata["privacyLevel"] as? String ?? "private") ?? .private
        }
        set {
            self.metadata["privacyLevel"] = newValue.rawValue
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Integrate SessionManager with Firebase
Update the existing `SessionManager.swift` to sync sessions with Firebase:

```swift
// Add to SessionManager class
@Published var sessionPrivacyLevel: Session.PrivacyLevel = .private

func completeSession() async {
    // ... existing session completion logic ...
    
    // Sync to Firebase if user is authenticated
    if FirebaseManager.shared.isAuthenticated {
        do {
            try await FirebaseManager.shared.saveSession(currentSession)
        } catch {
            print("Failed to sync session to Firebase: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 2B: Advanced Social Features (Priority 2)

### 1. Friends System Implementation
**Goal**: Allow users to connect with friends and see their music activity

**Files to Create:**
- `FriendsManager.swift` - Friend connections and management

- `AddFriendsView.swift` - Search and add friends interface

**Key Features:**
- Friend requests (send/accept/decline)
- Friends list with online status
- Friend activity feed
- Privacy controls for friend visibility

**Firebase Collections to Add:**
```javascript
// Firestore structure
social_connections/{connectionId} {
  userId1: string,
  userId2: string,
  status: "pending" | "accepted" | "blocked",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  acceptedAt: timestamp?
}

friend_requests/{requestId} {
  fromUserId: string,
  toUserId: string,
  status: "pending" | "accepted" | "declined",
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### 2. Social Feed Implementation
**Goal**: Show a timeline of friend music activity and discoveries

**Files to Create:**
- `SocialFeedView.swift` - Main social timeline
- `FeedItemView.swift` - Individual feed item component
- `SocialFeedManager.swift` - Feed data management

**Feed Item Types:**

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Code Architecture Principles
1. **Maintain existing design system**: Use established colors, typography, animations
2. **Follow SwiftUI best practices**: @StateObject, @EnvironmentObject, proper data flow
3. **Real-time updates**: Use Firebase listeners for live data
4. **Privacy-first**: Always respect user privacy settings
5. **Offline support**: Cache data locally for offline viewing
6. **Performance**: Optimize for smooth scrolling and quick loading

### UI/UX Guidelines
1. **Consistent with existing app**: Match the dark theme with purple/blue gradients
2. **Smooth animations**: Use subtle animations for state changes
3. **Loading states**: Show proper loading indicators
4. **Empty states**: Provide encouraging empty state messages
5. **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options

### Firebase Best Practices
1. **Security rules**: Implement proper Firestore security rules
2. **Data structure**: Design for scalability and query efficiency
3. **Real-time listeners**: Use snapshot listeners for live updates
4. **Batch operations**: Use transactions for data consistency
5. **Offline persistence**: Enable Firestore offline persistence
