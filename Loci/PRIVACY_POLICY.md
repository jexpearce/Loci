## Introduction

Loci ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service"). 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using our Service, you consent to the practices described in this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide Directly

- **Account Information**: Email address, display name, and profile picture when you create an account
- **Location Information**: You may choose to provide location information either automatically through GPS or manually by selecting locations on a map
- **Music Preferences**: Information about your music taste and preferences that you share through the app

### Information We Collect Automatically

- **Spotify Data**: When you connect your Spotify account, we access your recently played tracks, currently playing track, and playlist information through Spotify's API
- **Usage Data**: Information about how you interact with the Service, including session data, feature usage, and app performance metrics
- **Device Information**: Device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information

### Location Information

Location data collection is entirely optional. You have three options:

- **Manual Location**: Manually select your location with your preferred level of precision
- **Automatic Location**: Allow GPS tracking with configurable precision levels (exact, building, neighborhood, or city level)

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and maintain the Service
- Create personalized music discovery experiences based on location

- Connect you with other users who share similar music tastes
- Improve and optimize the Service
- Communicate with you about the Service
- Ensure the security and integrity of the Service

## Data Anonymization and Protection

### Privacy-First Design

- **Data Anonymization**: All shared data is anonymized using cryptographic hashing before being shared with other users
- **Location Precision Control**: You control the precision level of your location data, from exact coordinates to city-level approximations
- **Time Fuzzing**: Timestamps can be rounded to your preferred precision level (exact, minute, hour, or day)
- **Anonymous Mode**: Option to use the Service with a session-specific anonymous identifier

### Data Minimization

We collect and process only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide the Service. You have granular controls over what information is shared:

- Location sharing (on/off)
- Listening activity sharing (on/off)
- Friend requests (allow/block)
- Online status visibility (on/off)

## Information Sharing

- **Spotify**: We access your Spotify data through their API in accordance with your Spotify account permissions
- **Service Providers**: We may share data with trusted service providers who assist in operating the Service, subject to strict confidentiality agreements
